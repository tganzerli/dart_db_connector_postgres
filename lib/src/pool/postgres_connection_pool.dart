/// PostgreSQL connection pool — Dart facade over the native pool.
///
/// ABI MAJOR 2 (2026-05-20): the pool is now a thin wrapper over the
/// C-side `native_pool_t` (`native/c/include/native_pool.h`). The C
/// pool owns the connections, the worker threads, and the libpq I/O
/// loop. The Dart side keeps a gate (`_inUse` counter + waiter queue)
/// so it never invokes the blocking `pool_acquire` — instead it calls
/// `pool_acquire(0)` once it knows a conn is free. That call is a true
/// non-blocking probe only because the native pool is created with a
/// default acquire timeout of 0 (`timeout_ms == 0` means "use the pool
/// default" in `native_pool.c`). This avoids deadlocking the isolate's
/// event loop when the pool is briefly over-subscribed.
///
/// Gate invariant: a unit of `_inUse` always has an owner. `_release`
/// hands the unit straight to the oldest waiter it wakes (the counter is
/// not touched), and every exit of `acquire()` that does not return a
/// connection gives the unit back through `_returnSlot()`.
///
/// Public surface (`PoolConfig`, `PostgresConnectionPool`,
/// `PooledConnection`, `PoolExhaustedException`) is preserved from
/// MAJOR 1 modulo the removal of `PoolConfig.onConnectionOpen`, which
/// no longer maps cleanly onto the C pool's eager-allocation model.
/// Callers that previously ran PREPARE on each fresh conn should now
/// submit those statements through the regular execute path.
