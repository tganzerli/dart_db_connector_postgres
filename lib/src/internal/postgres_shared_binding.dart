/// Per-isolate singleton holder for [PostgresBinding].
///
/// The public API of `dart_db_connector` (`PostgresConnectionPool`,
/// `withTransaction`, etc.) hides FFI from consumers. Internally, all of
/// these need access to a configured [PostgresBinding] (which wraps
/// `libnative_db` symbols + initialised Dart Native API). Constructing
/// that binding manually is exactly what the public API removes — consumer
/// shouldn't import `PostgresBinding` nor call `loadNativeDb` directly.
///
/// This singleton resolves the binding lazily on the first call. Each
/// Dart isolate gets its own instance (Dart statics are per-isolate by
/// nature). Within a given isolate the binding is created once and
/// reused — including the one-time call to `Dart_InitializeApiDL`,
/// which must happen exactly once per isolate before any
/// `Dart_PostCObject_DL` from a native thread.
///
/// Marked `@internal` (via `package:meta`) so external consumers of the
/// package don't accidentally depend on the helper — they should only
/// touch `PostgresConnectionPool` and the rest of the public surface.
