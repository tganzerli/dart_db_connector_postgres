/// Resolves the native shared library of each driver that still lives in this

///
/// The path-walking mechanism moved to `package:dart_db_connector_core`
/// (`library_resolver.dart`) on 2026-09-08, when MongoDB became its own
/// package: a resolver that hard-codes one package name cannot serve more than
/// one package. What stays here is the per-driver data — filenames, the
/// environment variable, the ABI pair — for PostgreSQL, the only driver left
/// in this package. MySQL and SQLite moved out on 2026-09-09; MongoDB on
/// 2026-09-08.
/// MongoDB's equivalent now lives in `dart_db_connector_mongo`.
///
/// Search order, the failure message and the `_native/<os>-<arch>/` layout are
/// documented on `openDriverLibrary`.
///
/// **Internal helper.** Consumers of `dart_db_connector` should not call this
/// directly — `PostgresConnectionPool` (and every other public entry point)
/// resolves the binding internally via the per-isolate `SharedBinding`
/// singleton. The functions stay exported within the package source tree
/// because tests, benchmark harnesses, and the internal `IsolateWorkerPool`
/// worker still need direct access. The `@internal` annotation triggers an
/// analyzer warning if it leaks into external code.
