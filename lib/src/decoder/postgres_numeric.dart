/// A Postgres `numeric` value, held exactly.
///
/// `numeric` is arbitrary-precision decimal, and Dart has no built-in
/// type for it. Decoding it into `double` — which this driver did until
/// 2026-09-10 — loses digits silently on money-sized values with more
/// than ~15 significant decimal digits.
///
/// **Representation.** The value is retained as the decimal text the
/// server produced, which is exact by construction: nothing is lost
/// between the wire and the consumer. [BigInt] is materialised only when
/// somebody asks for exactness, so the hot path (decode) costs the same
/// as before — a `numeric` arrives as decimal text either way, and now
/// that text is simply kept instead of parsed into a `double`.
///
/// ```dart
/// final amount = row.getNumeric('total')!;
/// print(amount);                 // 1234.56  — exact
/// print(amount.unscaledValue);   // 123456
/// print(amount.scale);           // 2
/// print(amount.toDouble());      // 1234.56  — lossy, explicitly
/// ```
///
/// **Non-finite values.** `numeric` is not only numbers: the type carries
/// `NaN`, `Infinity` and `-Infinity` as states of its own, in the `sign`
/// field of the binary format (`NUMERIC_NAN`, `NUMERIC_PINF`,
/// `NUMERIC_NINF`).
/// They are not floating-point artefacts that an exact type avoids.
/// [toString] and [toDouble] handle them; [unscaledValue] and [scale]
/// have no meaning for them and throw [StateError]. Ask [isFinite] first
/// when reading a column that can hold one.
///
/// **Equality is on the representation, not on the number.** `1.10` and
/// `1.1` are the same quantity and different `numeric` values: Postgres
/// keeps a display scale (`dscale`) and so does this type. Two instances
/// are `==` when their text matches. To compare quantities, compare
/// [unscaledValue] after aligning [scale], or go through [toDouble] when
/// the precision loss is acceptable.
