/// native_pool.h — Native thread/conn pool (thread-per-conn).
///
/// Added in ABI MAJOR 2 as the runtime infrastructure.
/// Each pool owns N PGconn* and N pthread workers in a
/// 1:1 mapping; each worker drains the single pending slot of its conn
/// via libpq blocking (`PQsendQuery` + `select`/`PQconsumeInput`/
/// `PQisBusy` loop) and notifies Dart via `Dart_PostCObject_DL`.
///
/// Ownership rules:
///   * `native_pool_t*` is owned by the Dart side; `pool_destroy`
///     blocks until all workers exit and `PQfinish` was called on
///     every conn.
///   * `native_conn_t*` is borrowed from the pool between
///     `pool_acquire` and `pool_release`. After `pool_release` the
///     handle MUST NOT be dereferenced by Dart.
///   * `PGresult*` returned by `poll_result(native_conn_t*)` is
///     caller-owned; release via `clear_result` (declared in
///     `native_db.h`).
///
/// Both `native_pool_t` and `native_conn_t` are opaque to Dart; the
/// Dart binding sees `Pointer<Void>` only.
