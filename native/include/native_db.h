/// Semantic ABI version. MAJOR changes on breaking edits; MINOR on additive ones.
/// MAJOR 1 → 2 introduced in 2026-05-20: `start_query_async` and
/// `start_pipeline_async` removed in favour of the native thread/conn
/// pool (`pool_*` in `native_pool.h`). `cancel_query(PGconn*)` was
/// renamed to `pool_cancel(native_conn_t*)`, and `poll_result`'s first
/// parameter changed type from `PGconn*` to `native_conn_t*`.
#define NATIVE_DB_ABI_VERSION_MAJOR 2
// MINOR bumps (additive, non-breaking):
//   1 → `pool_submit_query_params` added (Extended Query Protocol —
//       parameter binding + optional binary result). 2026-05-23.
//       Legacy `pool_submit_query` preserved unchanged.
//   2 → `pool_submit_multi_read` added (N read statements in one
//       round-trip, results preserved as a per-conn chain) plus
//       `get_result_status` / `get_error_message` (surface the real
//       server error of a PGresult). 2026-07-28. Legacy paths
//       unchanged.
//   3 → `WORKER_PORT_CONN_LOST` (int64 = 3) added to the worker port
//       vocabulary in `native_pool.h`: a lost link is reported
//       distinctly from a timeout, and the worker reconnects the slot
//       with a sliced `PQresetStart`/`PQresetPoll`. 2026-09-11. No
//       signature changes; every existing symbol keeps its meaning.
//
//       CONSERVATIVE BY DECLARATION, not by trigger. None of the seven
//       triggers of the ABI policy
//       fires literally — what enters the header is a `#define`, not a
//       function. The bump is deliberate anyway: the value crosses the
//       FFI boundary and is interpreted by the Dart side, and a package
//       that does not know code 3 would otherwise read it as success.
//   4 → `pool_create_with_error` added: `pool_create` plus a caller-owned
//       buffer that receives the libpq message of a failed startup (TLS
//       errors included) instead of stderr. 2026-10-04. `pool_create`
//       unchanged.
//   5 → `pool_submit_query_params_prefixed` added: a parameterless prefix
//       statement (e.g. a deferred `BEGIN`) plus one Extended query sent
//       in libpq pipeline mode under a single Sync — one round-trip.
//       2026-10-09. `pool_submit_query_params` unchanged.
//   6 → `pool_submit_query_params_prefixed_n` (N parameterless prefixes
//       before one Extended query, one Sync; MINOR 5's single-prefix
//       form becomes its N = 1 case) and `pool_conn_transaction_status`
//       (libpq's local transaction state, no round-trip). Built for the
//       deferred pool session reset. 2026-10-10. Existing symbols
//       unchanged.
