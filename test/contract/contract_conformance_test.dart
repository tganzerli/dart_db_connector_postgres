/// Vertical-contract conformance — the check that the split into
/// per-DBMS packages cannot quietly become a split into divergent
/// architectures.
///
/// Two halves:
///
///  1. **Static.** `_staticConformance` below does not run; it only has to
///     compile. If a driver stops implementing `UnitOfWork<E>` or
///     `Repository<T, K>`, this file fails to compile and the divergence
///     is caught before it merges.
///
///  2. **Behavioural.** The battery in `package:dart_db_connector_conformance`,
///     driven once per driver against a real database. Each driver skips
///     gracefully when its native lib or its server is unavailable, in
///     the same way the existing integration tests do.
///
/// MongoDB used to appear here in the static half. It moved to its own
/// package on 2026-09-08 and carries its own conformance file
/// (`packages/dart_db_connector_mongo/test/contract_conformance_test.dart`),
/// which is the point of the split: the obligation travels with the driver.
