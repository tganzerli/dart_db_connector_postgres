/// scan guard: if someone reintroduces a file of another driver here, or makes the
/// common layer import a driver, the test still catches it. And the file floor (see the
/// test `the source tree was found`) keeps the suite from passing empty when run from
/// the wrong directory.
///
/// The property held by discipline until 2026-09-08, when an audit found the four

/// It is a deliberately textual check: it reads the `import` directives and never loads
