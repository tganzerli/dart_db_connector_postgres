/// Connection-loss detection and slot reconnection — ABI MINOR 3.
///
/// The fourth gap of the Postgres driver was not "call `PQreset`": there
/// was no detection, no invalidation and no recreation. `PQstatus` ran
/// exactly once per slot, at bootstrap, and a dead conn went back to the
/// free-list to fail forever.
///
/// These tests kill the server side of a live connection with
/// `pg_terminate_backend` and assert the three halves of the contract:
///
///   1. the loss is reported as `WORKER_PORT_CONN_LOST` (3), which is
///      distinct from the timeout code (2) — before MINOR 3 both
///      arrived as 2 and a dead link was indistinguishable from a slow
///      query;
///   2. the slot recovers on its own, so the pool survives a server
///      that blinks;
///   3. a port code this package does not know is **never** treated as
///      success.
///
/// Requires a running local Postgres (localhost:5432, dbname=teste).
